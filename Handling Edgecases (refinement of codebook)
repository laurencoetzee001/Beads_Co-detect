Handling Edgecases (refinement of codebook)
# Edge Case Analysis Framework

## Systematic Review Process

For each edge case, we'll follow this structured analysis:

### Step 1: Text Presentation
- **Edge Case ID**: [ID number]
- **AI Confidence**: [0.20-0.65]
- **Original Text**: [Full text of the problematic entry]

### Step 2: Ambiguity Identification
**What made this case difficult?**
- [ ] Unclear exchange language
- [ ] Temporal ambiguity (historical vs. contemporary)
- [ ] Multiple possible interpretations
- [ ] Missing context
- [ ] Cultural/linguistic barriers
- [ ] Complex multi-step transaction
- [ ] Implicit vs. explicit information

### Step 3: Current Codebook Analysis
**How would current rules handle this?**
- What does the current codebook say?
- Where are the gaps or ambiguities?
- What additional guidance is needed?

### Step 4: Expert Decision
**Your guidance:**
- How should this case be coded?
- What's the reasoning?
- What rule would prevent future confusion?

### Step 5: Rule Creation
**New codebook addition:**
- Specific rule for this scenario
- Examples and counter-examples
- Integration with existing rules

## Edge Case Categories to Track

### Category A: Exchange Determination Ambiguity
- Unclear action verbs
- Implicit transactions
- Value statements vs. actual exchanges

### Category B: Temporal Context Issues
- Historical accounts vs. contemporary observations
- Hypothetical vs. actual scenarios
- Mixed timeframes

### Category C: Function Classification Problems
- Multiple overlapping functions
- Unclear aesthetic vs. social functions
- Trade vs. currency distinctions

### Category D: Group/Party Identification Issues
- Unclear ethnic group references
- Local vs. traveler ambiguity
- Complex multi-party scenarios

### Category E: Measurement and Description Issues
- Unclear bead descriptions
- Complex measurement units
- Missing contextual information

## Running Analysis Log

| Case ID | Confidence | Category | Issue | Resolution | New Rule |
|---------|------------|----------|-------|------------|----------|
| [To be filled as we analyze each case] |

## Iterative Improvement Tracking

**Iteration 1 Results**: 16 edge cases (2.0%)
**Target for Iteration 2**: <8 edge cases (1.0%)

**Key Metrics to Track**:
- Edge case reduction rate
- Confidence score improvements
- Inter-rater reliability (if multiple coders)
- Rule coverage completeness
